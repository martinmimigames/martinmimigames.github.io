      Our Mission
    </h1>
    <div class="body">
      <p>There are a lot of apps on the internet already, so why should we make more?</p>
      <p>Simple, we do not find them <b>satisfactory</b>.</p>
      <p>First, most apps are far too <b>big</b>.</p>
      <p>More often than not, we find apps that are 1 MB, 20 MB, 500 MB big. Why should we be satisfied on that. We
        believe that storage space is <b>important</b>, and should not be taken up by <b>disproportionally</b> big simple apps.</p>
      <p>Second, most apps are not as <b>compatible</b> as we hope they can.</p>
      <p>Once in a while, operating systems updates, and apps drop supports for older systems. However, this would
        obsolete <b>working</b> devices, wouldn't it? We believe that the older devices are functionally fine, and people should not throw
        them away just because they are only <b>depreciated</b>.</p>
      <p>Finally, many apps are too <b>privacy invasive</b>. More often than not, random apps ask for seemingly <b>unrelated</b>
        permissions. But why should we allow that? We own our own privacy, don't we? We believe that apps should only
        request permissions what they need. <b>No more, no less</b>.</p>
      <p>Of course, we can't just say stuff and do nothing. Or else we wouldn't be reliable, would we?</p>
      <p>This is why we, <em>Martinmimigames</em>, now pursue this path to create <b>tiny</b>, <b>compatible</b>, <b>non-invasive</b> apps.</p>
      <p>Firstly, we try to write as <b>little</b> code to map to native functions provided by the platform. This greatly reduce
        both <b>app size</b> and surface for code <b>error</b> and <b>vulnerability</b>.</p>
      <p>Secondly, we do so by writing our own <a href="/projects/code.html">custom libraries</a> and codes, and only use third-party libraries only when
        <b>absolutely necessary</b>. This allows us to control most if not all aspect of our code, allowing for custom
        <b>optimization</b> and <b>compatibility</b>.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, we ensure changes to the app is <b>beneficial</b> to the user experience and is <b>reasonable</b> in terms of size
        increase. This means our apps can focus on being tiny, instead of introducing <b>unnecessary bloat</b>.</p>
      <p>Finally, we <b>listen</b> and <b>respond</b> to user requests that <b>improve</b> our apps, this ensures the apps fits the needs of
        the users, instead of what we assumed they need.</p>
      <p>We are certain that with our mission, we are adding <b>valuable</b> apps to the internet and the world.</p>
